Media Asset Management System "Stratus" is getting replaced with "FrameLight".
 - Framelight is Cloud based.
 - Stratus looks at assets from one site, whereas FrameLight looks at assets from various locations.
 - Stratus needs physical servers to scale up, whereas FrameLight has the capacity to scale up and down for big events. Eg: Olympics
 - Framelight has live recording to a server and an editor can log into a web browser ans start cutting the highlights within 30 seconds of the action happening.
